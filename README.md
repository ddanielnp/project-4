# Hatchpodz

This project is the only client project undergoing completion in WDI 11. It was forwarded by former WDI member Jerel Lim who is interested in starting his own business. This business would be a space where artists and likeminded individuals could rent out in proximity, utilizing facilities to promote their art or individual business. This concept is not unlike Spacemob.

Our job was to create an admin system that would act as a management tool to allow an admin in charge of the facility to keep track of the spaces being utilized by clients. This would involve the following requirements:
* Can keep track of the number of spaces in existance (office, hot-desk, meetingroom, eventroom)
* Can keep track of which member is renting which space.
* A page for advertisements. Only for members, so that they may get inside deals. Members can post.
* Has an admin that has overall control. The admin can create any number of users, as well as other admins.
* Admin can create new spaces, and assign different spaces to different members.
* Admin can create events.
* Admin can make meeting bookings.

## Our project

As soon as the our group decided to accept Jerel's project, we met with him over the weekend and then set to work. Our first few interactions involved creating ERDs and figuring out the exact requirements of our client.
